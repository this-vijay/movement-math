<!-- If you're already quite familiar with 3-D rotations, or if you're eager to get to the movement-based puzzles, you can skip ahead to Lesson Two: exploring orientation space through movement.-->

In this first lesson, we look at some basic properties of spatial orientations and rotations.  If you're already quite familiar with 3-D rotations, or if you're eager to get to the movement-based puzzles, you can safely skip ahead to <a href="./lesson-2.html" style="margin: 0;">Lesson Two: exploring orientation space through movement</a>.

When exploring the set of <i>all</i> spatial orientations, one of the most basic questions we can ask is, <i>how big is this set?</i> 
</md>

<p> Let's try to answer this question:</p>

    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `True`,
      response: `No, it will not be fully determined.  For example, there are many spatial orientations that will allow Bala's nose vector to point at you!`
    },
    {
      correct: true,
      answer: `False`,
      response: `Correct, there is a whole circle's worth of spatial orientations Bala can explore, while keeping the direction of his nose vector fixed.`

    {
      correct: true,
      answer: `True`,
      response: `That's right, together the nose vector and the hat vector will fully determine a spatial orienation.  Can you see why it takes three parameters to determine a nose vector and a hat vector?`
    },
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `False`,
      response: `Actually, if both Bala's nose vector and hat vector are fixed, then it will be impossible to shift his spatial orientation.`
    }
  ]">
</mcq>




<p> With three degrees of freedom, the set of spatial orientations is rather large!  How can we navigate this vast set?</p>

<md>
Although they have many quirks, 3-D rotations are still the most natural way to travel through the set of all spatial orientations.  
</md>

<!-- And once we specify a rotation-order, rotations about the x, y, and z axes do provide a useful way of specifying spatial orientations, despite the redundancies.-->

<p> Let's bring our attention back to the <i>set of all spatial orientations</i> -- which is actually much more than just a set. It is natural to think of it as a <i>space</i>, namely, <i>orientation space</i> !</p>
