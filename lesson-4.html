In this fourth lesson, we tie up several loose ends.  First we use quaternions to parametrize the various loops and homotopies from Lesson Two. We then meet a virtual avatar of Bala, built in the open-source 3-D animation software Blender, who can read and perform all our previous discoveries, now in quaternion form.

We then look at how quaternions act on R³ as spatial rotations, via a surprisingly simple formula for the image of a point (x, y, z) under a quaternion rotation q.  Finally, using Blender, we get a glimpse of the relations between infinitesimal rotations - also known as the <i>Lie bracket</i> on the Lie algebra of SO(3). 

<!--Note that this lesson will be more challenging mathematically: some comfort with functions of multiple variables will be useful.-->

<p> First, let's try paramtetrizing a simple 360° rotation loop:</p>

We still haven't proved that the group of 3-D rotations is isomorphic to the group of unit quaternions modulo sign.  But our formula for the action of unit quaternions on R³ is a useful starting point!

<p> Long ago we mentioned that even infinitesimal rotations are somehow entangled.  Using Blender, we can now see exactly how:</p>

  If you'd like to know more about Lie groups and Lie algebras, I recommend John Stillwell's <i>Naive Lie Theory</i>, which nicely complements everything we've done so far, and provides a rigorous framework for further exploration.
